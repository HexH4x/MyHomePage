            I am a person.

        <h2>What I'm working on</h2>
        <p>
            I'm learning everything I can about cybersecurity, while also building a strong foundation by working towards getting my CompTIA A+, Networking+, and Security+ certifications. I'm especially passionate about learning Linux commands and pursuing my Linux Essentials certifications, as that will allow me to more easily work within Kali Linux, and who doesn't want more Kali in their life?
