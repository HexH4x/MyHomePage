<h3><span style="color: #ffffff;">Who am I?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The eternal question, and something I wouldn't dare answer because I am wonderfully&nbsp;<em>in progress</em>. I hope to never stop learning, never lose my excitment for the future, and never stop asking 'what if?".&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">I'm passionate about learning cybersecurity and ethical hacking, but in order to be effective I need a solid foundation in general computer knowledge and networking. I'm working towards obtaining my CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+ certifications within the year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">I'm especially enthusiastic about mastering Linux, as that will allow me to better utilize Kali Linux and all the tools it offers for penetration testing as I practice and grow my skills.&nbsp;</span></p>
