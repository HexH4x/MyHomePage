Hello, world! I’m Lindsey Armstrong, a cybersecurity enthusiast, tech tinkerer, and lifelong learner on a mission to make a difference in the digital world. With a mix of curiosity, empathy, and determination, I’m working to master the tools and techniques needed to protect people and their data.

In the short term, I’m looking for hands-on experience in IT and cybersecurity—somewhere I can put my skills to work, grow through real-world challenges, and pursue higher-level certifications. Long term, I aim to earn a bachelor’s in cybersecurity, deepen my knowledge of automation and coding, and hone my skills with offensive tools like Metasploit and Burp Suite.

What really drives me is the human aspect of cybersecurity. Phishing attacks and other cyber threats aren’t just technical problems—they’re personal ones, with real victims. My goal is to develop the expertise to help companies safeguard their employees’ and customers’ data, and by extension, protect people in their daily lives.

When you browse my GitHub, you’ll see a portfolio that reflects my curiosity and commitment. I don’t just skim the surface of topics—I dive in, put concepts into practice, and stick with them until I create something meaningful. From networking to scripting, every project is a step toward becoming the best version of myself as a cybersecurity professional.

For me, coding is pure magic. The thrill of typing the right command or building a script that just works never gets old. It’s like playing music: each line of code, like each note in a song, contributes to something greater. My background as a bassist taught me the value of teamwork, discipline, and harmony—lessons I carry with me into every collaboration, whether it’s coding or solving security puzzles.

Outside of tech, I’m all about blending creativity and technology. Whether it’s writing AI-generated songs about silly life moments, crafting music videos with generative art, or just geeking out about what’s possible, I love using tech to create and connect.

Over the past year, I’ve gained certifications like CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, and ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity, while also breaking into the top 4% on TryHackMe. I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished, but I’m even more excited about what’s ahead. I want to be more than just an employee—I want to be an asset, someone who brings energy, ideas, and results to the table.

When I’m not exploring the cybersecurity landscape, I’m drawing from my experience as a retail manager to build strong communication and empathy skills. Whether it’s resolving a tricky customer issue or tackling a technical challenge, I believe in treating everyone with kindness and understanding.

Thanks for stopping by my GitHub! If you share a love of cybersecurity, coding, or creative projects, let’s connect and make something awesome.
